# Music Recommendation AI

This project aims to develop a Python program that utilizes various libraries and web resources to provide personalized music recommendations to users. The program collects user preferences, analyzes music data from online sources, and generates tailored music recommendations based on the provided input.

## Features

1. **User Input**: Allow users to input their music preferences, including genres, artists, moods, and tempo.
2. **Data Collection**: Utilize web scraping techniques with tools like BeautifulSoup or the Google Python library to gather music data from online sources such as music streaming platforms, music blogs, or music review websites.
3. **Data Analysis**: Process the collected music data to extract relevant information such as genres, artist similarities, and user preferences using libraries like pandas and numpy.
4. **Recommendation Algorithm**: Implement AI algorithms or machine learning techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation systems to generate personalized music recommendations based on the user's music preferences.
5. **Output**: Present the recommendations in a user-friendly format, such as a web interface or text-based output, allowing users to explore recommended songs, albums, or artists.

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Music Experience**: Users can discover new music that aligns with their unique preferences and interests.
2. **Seamless Data Integration**: The program relies on web scraping techniques to gather up-to-date music data, eliminating the need for locally stored music databases.
3. **Diverse Music Options**: By utilizing various online sources, the program can introduce users to a wide range of music genres, artists, and recommendations.
4. **Flexible and Dynamic**: The program can adapt to changing user preferences and incorporate real-time music updates from online sources.

## Program Overview

The provided Python program demonstrates the functionality of the Music Recommendation AI project:

```python
import pandas as pd

class MusicRecommendationAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_preferences = {"genres": [], "artists": [], "moods": [], "tempo": ""}

    def gather_user_preferences(self):
        # Collect user preferences for genres, artists, moods, and tempo
        self.user_preferences["genres"] = input("Enter preferred genres (comma-separated): ").split(",")
        self.user_preferences["artists"] = input("Enter preferred artists (comma-separated): ").split(",")
        self.user_preferences["moods"] = input("Enter preferred moods (comma-separated): ").split(",")
        self.user_preferences["tempo"] = input("Enter preferred tempo: ")

    def fetch_music_data(self):
        # Retrieve music data from online sources or replace the link with an actual dataset link
        music_data = pd.read_csv("https://example.com/music_data.csv", encoding="utf-8")
        return music_data

    def generate_recommendations(self, music_data):
        # Generate music recommendations based on user preferences
        recommendations = pd.DataFrame()
        if "Genre" in music_data:
            recommendations = music_data[
                music_data["Genre"].isin(self.user_preferences["genres"])
                & music_data["Artist"].isin(self.user_preferences["artists"])
                & music_data["Mood"].isin(self.user_preferences["moods"])
                & (music_data["Tempo"] == self.user_preferences["tempo"])
            ]
        return recommendations

    def present_recommendations(self, recommendations):
        # Display the recommendations to the user
        print("Music Recommendations:")
        if recommendations.empty:
            print("No recommendations found.")
        else:
            print(recommendations)

    def run(self):
        # Main execution flow of the program
        self.gather_user_preferences()
        music_data = self.fetch_music_data()
        recommendations = self.generate_recommendations(music_data)
        self.present_recommendations(recommendations)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    recommendation_ai = MusicRecommendationAI()
    recommendation_ai.run()
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the provided Python script for the Music Recommendation AI project.
2. Install the required libraries (e.g., pandas) and ensure they are compatible with your Python environment.
3. Run the Python script (`python music_recommendation.py`) to execute the program.
4. Enter your preferred music genres, artists, moods, and tempo when prompted.
5. The program will gather music data from online sources or a provided dataset.
6. Based on your preferences, the program will generate personalized music recommendations.
7. The recommendations will be presented in the console output, allowing you to explore and discover new music.

Feel free to modify the program to suit your specific needs, such as incorporating additional recommendation algorithms, integrating with a web interface, or expanding the range of data sources.

## Conclusion

The Music Recommendation AI project provides users with personalized music recommendations by leveraging web scraping techniques and AI algorithms. By implementing this program, users can enhance their music discovery experience and explore a diverse range of music tailored to their unique preferences.
